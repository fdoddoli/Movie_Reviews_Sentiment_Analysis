# Abstract

Companies handle vast amounts of information, which, due to their volume, enable the creation of artificial intelligence models with machine learning capabilities to perform valuable functions such as classification and prediction of new information. Through the implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, this research highlights the relevance of using artificial intelligence in natural language processing and sentiment analysis. These tools can provide valuable insights for decision-making in industries dealing with large amounts of text data that require sentiment classification. LSTM networks are a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that have proven to be effective in processing sequential data, such as sentiment classification of text.

In this study, a machine learning model was developed using a movie review dataset that includes positive and negative opinions. The exploratory analysis and preliminary results are presented. Subsequently, a method is proposed that includes data preprocessing, model architecture, configuration, and layers, defining their scope. Next, tests are defined to optimize or adjust the parameters, as well as tests for model constraints, such as reviews in Spanish or with misspelled words. Finally, the performance results of the model are presented, considering the training, validation, and prediction stages. In this final stage, besides analyzing the model's accuracy and loss, its limitations are determined through a confusion matrix. Lastly, the impact of multiple parameters on the model is reflected upon.

This research demonstrates how the use of a machine learning model through a Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture achieves sentiment classification of a review as positive or negative with an 85% accuracy rate.
